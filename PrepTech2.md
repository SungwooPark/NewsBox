#Preparation and Framing 2

##Background and context
* We run sentiment analysis on tweets from different regions in the US and show the average polarity of each region using a choropleth map
  * We use Twitter as our source of public opinion
  * We search Twitter using both a search term and specified location
  * We run sentiment analysis on the list of tweets for each region using Indico’s API
  * We find the average polarity of tweets for each region
  * We create a choropleth map for data visualization



##Key questions
* What other functionality can we add to this program
* Other way of visualizing sentiment data other than a choropleth map?
* How useful do you think the alternative visualization will be?
* How do we make our map easier to understand (how do we exaggerate slight differences in polarity)?
* Where do we go from here?



##Agenda for technical review session
* We’ll start by describing the agenda for our presentation -- we’ve made a lot of changes since last time
* Next, we’ll describe our process (background and context, UML diagram)
* We’ll show people our prototype
* Then we’ll present our key questions and ask for feedback
