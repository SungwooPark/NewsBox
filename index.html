<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<p>NewsBox wasn't always the glamorous tweet-sentiment-choropleth-map-producing program you see now. Once upon a time, NewsBox had a very different mission: We wanted to see if there was a causal relationship between the positivity of news sources and public opinion towards different topics. We even created a mock-up of what our program might produce. </p>
![NewsBox's Original Vision](Desktop/dumb_map.jpg)

<p>After our first technical review, we came up with a better idea. Rather than produce line graphs of average media and Twitter polarity over time towards a certain search term, we could produce a choropleth map that compared the polarity of tweets from different regions in the US. We scrapped the News part of NewsBox and began working on our new idea. We started with a blank map of the US in the form of an SVG file. We made changes to our original code so we could collect Tweets based on location and we wrote new code to produce a choropleth map given average polarity values for the four main regions of the US.</p>

<p>We went into our second Technical Review looking mainly for feedback on how we should improve the data visualization part of our project (How can we make the map pretty?). We received and incorporated a number of good suggestions, such as adding numberical values to the map, changing the color scheme, and adding the search term to the map picture (so when you save the map, you know what search term it represents). These suggestions resulted in a much improved visualization of our data, as you can see below.</p>

<p>And here we are now.</p>
