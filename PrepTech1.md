#Preparation and Framing

##Background and context
* We’re primarily interested in data analysis, but also data visualization.
* We want to use sentiment analysis (measuring polarity) to compare the attitudes of different news sources towards various topics with public opinion.
  * Ex. Does Fox talk about immigration more negatively than people on Twitter?
* We’ll be using Twitter and possibly other social media platforms (YikYak, etcetera) to measure public opinion -- some possible news sources include CNN, Fox, MSNBC, BBC, Washington Post, New York Times, etcetera.
* We want to see if there is causation between the two -- does public opinion determine news sources’ attitudes on certain subjects or do news sources’ attitudes determine public opinion?
  * Ex. Does CNN seem to be good at either predicting or influencing public opinion towards certain topics?
  * Ex. Do the new sources seem to adopt public opinion on different topics?


##Key questions
* We’d like more ideas on what we could do with text analysis and analyzing news sources/public opinion.
  * What else do you think we could look at?
* How else can we analyze our dataset to answer our question?
* What other interesting questions can we answer with out current dataset and data analysis method?
* We’d also like people to help us think of cool ways to visualize our data
  * How can we present our data in a compelling/interesting way?


##Agenda for technical review session
* We’re going to start by describing the agenda for our presentation -- we want help fleshing out our ideas and thinking of both new ways to answer our current question and new questions we can answer with our current data and data analysis method.
* Next, we’ll provide background and context -- talk about where we are and where we want to go.
* Then, we’ll present our key questions and hold a collaborative ideation session -- hopefully we’ll get some new/useful ideas out of it.
  * This will take up the bulk of our presentation -- we’ll introduce the key questions one at a time and think of answers to it before moving on to the next question (so we don’t throw too much at the other teams at once).
